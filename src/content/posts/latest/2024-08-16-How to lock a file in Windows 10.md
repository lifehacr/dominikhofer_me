There are many ways to keep our files secured. Various platforms provide us **"Cloud Facilities"**, so that we can access our files from wherever we want. Quite a lot of people use portable devices like _Pendrives, Thumb drives, Hard Drives_, etc.

There is a method in **Windows 10/8/7**, which can be used to store all important files and folders encrypted with a **password without installing any additional software**. This is basically a pre-defined _".bat"_ file which _encrypts all your data_ within the specified folder and will decrypt only upon authorized password.
