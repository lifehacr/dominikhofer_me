> Computers have evolved through several "generations," each marked by significant technological advancements:

**First Generation (1940s-1950s)**: These were massive machines using vacuum tubes. Think ENIAC and UNIVAC.

**Second Generation (1950s-1960s)**: Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable. IBM 1401 is a classic example.

**Third Generation (1960s-1970s)**: Integrated Circuits (ICs) came into play, which further miniaturized computers. This period also saw the birth of operating systems.

**Fourth Generation (1970s-Present)**: Microprocessors revolutionized everything. Personal computers (PCs) became mainstream, ushering in the era of Apple, Microsoft, and the internet boom.

**Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond)**: Based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. This generation aims for computers that can understand natural language and learn from experience. Quantum computing and advanced AI are at the forefront.
