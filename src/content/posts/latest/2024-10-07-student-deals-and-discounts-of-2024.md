How to Get a Student Discount
-----------------------------

There are two typical ways to get a student discount.

Ask if a local store offers special student discounts.
Many college-town restaurants, video game resale stores and boutiques offer college student discounts—this is the businesses' way of showing student support. Be proud to be frugal, and don't be afraid to ask. Most student discounts are not prominently displayed. Negotiation and frugality are both life skills that will serve you throughout your education and later in life!

Always have your student ID on you and know your student email address.
You'll often need some sort of student identification to prove your student status: Typically, this can be a valid student ID, high school or college. If you're shopping online, you may need to verify your status with your high school or college email address.

In some instances, well-known retailers use an identification verification service such as [ID.me](https://www.id.me/individuals/ecommerce). [UNiDAYS](https://www.myunidays.com/US/en-US/support/verifying) is also a discount website that requires a verified student ID.

In addition to the above student savings, be sure to visit [KD.ms](https://kd.ms) website regularly.
