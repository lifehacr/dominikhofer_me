## What Happens When You Close Your Laptop's Lid? ğŸ’»ğŸ”‹âœ¨

When you close the lid of your laptop, several things can happen depending on your operating system and your laptop's power settings:

#### Potential Actions:
1. **Sleep Mode**: 
   - The most common setting. Your laptop saves your session to RAM and enters a low-power state. It allows you to resume your work quickly when you open the lid.

2. **Hibernate Mode**: 
   - Your laptop saves your session to the hard drive and then powers off completely. It uses no power but takes a bit longer to start back up compared to sleep mode.

3. **Shut Down**: 
   - Your laptop closes all programs and turns off. This is less common for a lid-close action but can be set manually.

4. **Do Nothing**: 
   - The laptop remains fully operational with the lid closed. This setting is useful if youâ€™re using an external monitor and keyboard.

You can usually configure these settings in your laptop's power options/preferences menu. If you're using Windows, you can find this under:
- **Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options**

On macOS, you can adjust these settings in:
- **System Preferences > Energy Saver**
